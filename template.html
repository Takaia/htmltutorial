        <p>After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance,
            and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the
            White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid
            gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting
            along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, ‘Oh! the
            Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her
            waiting!’ Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of
            any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low,
            timid voice, ‘If you please, sir--’ The Rabbit started violently,
            dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the
            darkness as hard as he could go.</p>
